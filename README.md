# GoogleSheets_DateParser
A date parser for Google sheets, to overcome certain shortcomings in Google sheets when inputting dates.

Copy all files into your google sheet scripts, setup the "sheets of interest" list and enjoy dates as never before.

Note. The code assumes input format to be in the order: day, month, year. This is probably easily changed, but i never had the need for that.
It will require a bit of rewiring in the state machine though.
